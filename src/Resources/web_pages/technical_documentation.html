                <h2>Abstract</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The project we are trying to build is a client-side insurance system that helps insurance clients with an efficient method of connection with their insurance company and managing their insurance policies. The system will help users with the ease access of their insurance policies, enlisting their insured properties with payment and accident histories and also includes payment methods which will decrease their frequent in-person visits of insurance offices and help them perform their desires whenever and from wherever they are, keeping their comfort.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <section class="main-section" id="Background_of_the_project">    
            <header>  
                <h2>Background of the project</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The project is motivated by a strong desire to alleviate the ongoing suffering that insurance clients endure as a result of existing insurance systems' lack of user-friendliness and inability to access services from remote areas. With an awareness of the evolving nature of the digital era, this initiative aims to transform the insurance experience. The utilization of revolutionary web technology and user-centered design approaches guarantees that clients may access and control their policies from nearly anywhere, including the comforts of their own homes. The platform's user-friendly interface offers easy navigation and a thorough comprehension of policy options, simplifying complicated insurance processes. This initiative is dedicated to eliminating geographical barriers and uncomfortable user experiences, making insurance services available and understandable for all clients in a world that is becoming more connected.</p>
            <p>Our system's main focus is on our cherished clients, who are the center of the insurance purchasing procedure. These are our valued insurance buyers—individuals or groups looking for insurance coverage. In general, the system is ready for final consumers who purchase insurance.</p>
            <p>The project provides an insurance system that is easy to use and convenient for the end user. This new, user-friendly system allows a client to access their insurance system portfolio, register for membership, track their overall spending, invest money, track their insured properties, see when the contract expires, pay their bills, receive payment notifications, and view a list of different insurance types.</p>
            <p>The primary organizations involved in this initiative are insurance companies, because they are the primary entities that the system will allow to interact with their clients. In addition to insurance companies, online payment systems like banks and other payment platforms will be connected to the project, and internet service providers will play a role in the system's accessibility as it is a web-based system that requires internet connectivity.</p>
            <p>Internet service providers and online payment platforms will supply the necessary resources for the project to be completed and made available as intended. The proper completion of this project will likewise have a significant positive impact on those businesses.</p>

                <h2>The Existing System</h2>
            </header>
            <p>There are serious deficiencies in the current insurance system that leave large gaps in important areas like remote access, time efficiency, and energy savings. Consumers anticipate convenient remote interactions these days, yet the system falls short, requiring in-person visits or challenging, time-consuming procedures. Moreover, the system isn't flexible enough to help consumers manage their insurance needs while saving time and effort. These weaknesses not only cause annoyance but also make it more difficult for the system to keep up with the fast-paced, technologically advanced society we live in. The time has come for a game-changing solution that closes these gaps and provides easily accessible, time- and energy-efficient features that meet the changing needs and demands of insurance consumers.</p>
            <p>In General, those companies reach their clients in person, but this totally won't fill the gap of the problem where there is a need to satisfy the needs of the clients while maintaining their comfort remotely.</p>

            <p>Provide a variety of channels for communication, including phone support, email, and live chat, to enable quick and efficient exchanges between customers and the insurance provider. This ensures that users can easily reach out for assistance or inquiries.</p>
            <p>For existing customers, the system will maintain a comprehensive database of their information, allowing them to conveniently access and update their details. This will prevent the occurrence of accidental duplicate payments by providing timely reminders before the payment due date.</p>
            <p>The system will incorporate automated notifications and reminders to keep users informed about policy renewals, premium due dates, claim status updates, and other important information, ensuring they stay engaged and proactive.</p>
            <p>Overall, the proposed solution aims to enhance the interaction between insurance companies and their customers by streamlining the data management process, improving accessibility, and reducing the need for physical visits to insurance offices.</p>

                <h2>Scope</h2>
            </header>
            <p>The project aims to deliver a comprehensive data management system for insurance companies, primarily focusing on enhancing customer interaction through a user-friendly website platform. The scope of the project includes the following key components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bold">Development of a user-friendly website:</span> The project will involve the design and construction of a website specifically tailored for insurance companies. This website will enable customers to register for insurance, manage their policies, and access relevant information. The primary objective is to create a seamless user experience, ensuring easy navigation and interaction between customers and the insurance company.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Customer registration and profile management:</span> The system will offer a convenient online registration process for new customers, eliminating the requirement for in-person visits to schedule appointments. Customers will be able to effortlessly create and manage their profiles on the website, allowing them to update personal information and access comprehensive details of their insurance policies.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Insurance policy management:</span> The system will empower customers to effectively track their insurance policies. Through the website, customers can conveniently access information about their coverage, payment history, and renewal dates. This feature will enable customers to efficiently manage their policies in a user-friendly manner.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Appointment scheduling for insurance assessments:</span> The system will facilitate the scheduling of insurance assessments, such as property inspections or health check-ups at affiliated hospitals. Customers will have the ability to book appointments online, reducing the need for manual coordination and enhancing convenience.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Payment reminders and notifications:</span> To ensure timely payments, the system will send reminders to customers before their insurance bill due dates. This feature will help customers avoid missed payments. Additionally, the system will provide notifications regarding policy updates, renewals, and other relevant information. It will also integrate with payment systems such as TeleBirr or other methods to facilitate secure and convenient payment transactions. Upon contract renewal, the system will send confirmation messages to clients, providing assurance and peace of mind.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The project does not involve conducting any physical inspections; instead, it focuses on appointing responsible officials to handle the physical inspection process. Additionally, it does not feature property registration with the insurance company. Rather, it functions as a client-side system that displays the properties insured under the client's name exclusively to the client. However, it does provide the capability to schedule appointments with the insurance company on behalf of the client when they wish to register new properties.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this project assumes the existence of an established system on the company's side that manages all client information, property details, and the registration of new clients. Therefore, our project aims solely to deliver a client-side system that facilitates seamless communication between the client and their insurance company.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that while the project will deliver a comprehensive data management system with the mentioned features, it will primarily focus on the customer-facing website and its associated functionalities. Furthermore, the integration of external systems or third-party services will only be included if explicitly specified.</p>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
            </header>
            <p>It is common knowledge that insurance firms operate their own systems to support their operations, but it is uncommon to discover a system designed primarily with the user's time, effort, and energy in mind. Our goal is to create a system that insurance firms can use, whether it is for property, health, or auto insurance, to make their customers' jobs easier, boost job satisfaction, and encourage more people to get insurance. Key features include appointment scheduling, payment history, payment methods and dates, renewal forms, and login for current users and new users. We intend to make good use of the approximately three months allotted for this project. Once a week, our teams get together to discuss the project and how to approach each step of the process. We also set deadlines for our tasks so that we have time to double-check and review our work. Additionally, we plan to visit some insurance companies, research the industry, ask users about their experiences, and effectively try to find solutions to their problems. Our objective is to use the well-known waterfall method to solve the issues.</p>
            <p>The Waterfall technique is a software development process that is divided into several phases to make things easier to follow. Our lecturer gave us the title of the selected idea after we had first attempted to generate a variety of workable ideas. The method's first step, requirement formulation, involves gathering information from users and other sources to define the system's services, restrictions, and objectives. The next step is the design phase, during which we review the first phase's requirement definition and create a system design that outlines the hardware and software needs as well as the general system architecture. After the design has been translated into codes or programs, the system will be integrated and tested to ensure that all software requirements have been satisfied. Finally, we attempt to fix any mistakes that may arise in the client environment but were missed the first time around.</p>
            <p>We plan on interviewing family members and clients of insurance companies in order to determine their needs. We are going to gather as much information as possible on the issues and challenges that customers have with insurance firms. Since we are students with limited time, we intend to schedule 25–50 interviews with various people at various locations and times. We also hope to meet or speak with some of our family members who have insurance in the next two weeks. By doing this, we can be sure that our requirements will be well-defined.</p>
            <p>When defining project constraints for a software system used by insurance companies, there are several factors to consider. Here are some constraints we take into account:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bold">Time Constraint:</span> we consider factors such as design, development, and testing to ensure the project is completed within the desired timeframe.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Security and Compliance Constraint:</span> Insurance companies deal with sensitive and confidential data, so ensuring the software system complies with the companies’ regulation is crucial. Implementing security measures to protect user data is a key constraint.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Integration Constraint:</span> we should determine if the software system needs to integrate with other existing systems used by insurance companies. This constraint will influence the design and implementation of the software to ensure smooth data exchange between systems.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Scalability Constraint:</span> Consider the expected growth and user base of insurance companies over time. The software system should be designed and architected in a way that allows for scalability, accommodating increased data volumes and user loads without compromising performance.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">User Experience Constraint:</span> Paying attention to the user interface and user experience design. Insurance company users should find the software intuitive, easy to navigate, and efficient and simple to use.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We can effectively define the project scope and set reasonable expectations for the development of a software system for users of insurance companies by taking these constraints into account.</p>
            <p>We must compare alternative design strategies because doing so could enhance quality by enabling us to assess various strategies, identify possible risks, and make well-informed decisions that put performance and reliability first. Insurance companies often have unique requirements and business processes. We can investigate various approaches to meeting those particular requirements by comparing alternative design strategies, which will enable us to tailor the software system to better meet the needs of the insurance company and its users.</p>
            <p>To ensure that the project constraints listed are appropriately reflected in our project, here are some steps to take:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="bold">Document the Constraints:</span> Begin by documenting all the identified constraints in a clear and organized manner. This documentation should include details about each constraint, such as the specific limitations, associated risks, and potential impact on the project. By having this information in one place, we can easily refer to it throughout the project's lifecycle.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Incorporate Constraints in Project Plan:</span> Once the constraints have been reviewed and agreed upon, it’s important to integrate them into the project plan. Evaluate the impact of each constraint on different phases of the project, such as requirements gathering, design, development, and testing.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Communicate:</span> Effective communication is crucial when dealing with project constraints. Clearly communicate the constraints, along with their implications, to all members. Ensure that everyone involved in the project understands the limitations and constraints are aligned with the plan to mitigate them.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Risk Management:</span> Consider potential risks associated with each constraint and develop mitigation strategies. Identify possible alternative approaches or solutions in case any of the constraints become too limiting or impossible to adhere to.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Regularly Evaluate and Revisit Constraints:</span> Periodically evaluate the constraints to determine if they are still valid and relevant. Project dynamics can change over time, and new factors may arise that impact the constraints.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We will implement the software system using programming languages such as <code>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</code> for the basic structure of the website or the frontend, and <code>SQL/MySQL, JavaScript, or Python</code>, whichever is appropriate, will be used for the backend. Frameworks like Angular/React, Bootstrap will be used for frontend, and <code>Node.js</code> or <code>Django</code> for the backend. We will also use <code>git/GitHub</code> for collaboration and version control systems. We will follow coding best practices, like clean code principle, adhere to the coding structures, conduct code reviews to ensure code quality, and identify potential issues.</p>
            <p>The user training and documentation process comes next, during which we create user manuals and other guides to help users and the insurance company utilize the system efficiently. In the end, we will need to maintain the system, which will involve keeping an eye on its functionality, tracking down any bugs or problems, updating it to keep up with new developments in technology, and persistently getting feedback from users to make changes that better suit their needs. We intend to examine alternative implementations in order to maximize effectiveness and efficiency, improve adaptability and flexibility, and reduce risks.</p>
